## About Deckset (macOS)
**Deckset for Mac** turns plain-text Markdown into elegant slides so you can focus on ideas instead of slide design. With curated themes and smart auto-layout, **Deckset on MacBook** keeps text legible, images balanced, and code blocks beautifully highlighted—ideal for talks, lessons, and internal briefings.

On macOS, **Deckset** integrates smoothly with your writing flow: keep your `.md` file in your favorite editor, then open it in Deckset to preview, rehearse, and present. You get instant live updates, keyboard-driven navigation, and a dedicated presenter view with speaker notes to keep delivery confident and clear.

For technical content, **Deckset for macOS** supports syntax highlighting, tables, math formulas, and build steps/transitions, helping you introduce concepts incrementally. Themes keep consistency across headings, lists, and callouts while respecting aspect ratios for projectors and external displays.

When it’s time to share, **Deckset Mac download** gives you a native app that exports reliably to PDF or images for email, LMS uploads, or archiving. Because your source is Markdown, versioning, collaboration via Git, and reuse across talks stay effortless.
